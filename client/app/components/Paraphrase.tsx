          Paraphrasing is the art of expressing an idea in your own words while
          maintaining its essence. It&apos;s like putting information into a new
          language to showcase your understanding. Instead of simply repeating
          what someone else has said, you reframe it. Paraphrasing is a helpful
          skill in writing because it lets you present information in your own
          way without copying directly from the source. It&apos;s a way to use your
          own voice to discuss someone else&apos;s ideas, which comes in handy,
          especially when working on projects to steer clear of plagiarism.
